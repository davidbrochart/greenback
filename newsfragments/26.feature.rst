greenback's internals have been reorganized to improve the performance of
executing ordinary checkpoints (``await`` statements, approximately) in
a task that has a greenback portal active. On the author's laptop with
CPython 3.12, the overhead is only about one microsecond compared to the
performance without greenback involved, versus four microseconds before
this change. For comparison, the non-greenback cost of executing a
checkpoint is 12-13 microseconds.
