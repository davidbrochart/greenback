New function :func:`greenback.with_portal_run_tree` is like
:func:`greenback.with_portal_run` for an entire Trio task subtree: it
will enable :func:`greenback.await_` not only in the given async
function but also in any child tasks spawned inside that
function. This feature relies on the Trio instrumentation API and is
thus unavailable on asyncio.

New function :func:`greenback.has_portal` determines whether the current
task, or another specified task, has a greenback portal set up already.
