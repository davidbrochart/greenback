We no longer assume that :func:`greenback.bestow_portal` is invoked from the
"main" greenlet of the event loop. This was not a safe assumption: any task
running with access to a greenback portal runs in a separate greenlet, and
it is quite plausible that such a task might want to :func:`~greenback.bestow_portal`
on another task.
